Energy-Technologies
===================

Comparison and Collection of off-grid energy harvesting and storage means.




ToDo:
need to complete the following lists:

List of generators:
* [Fire-based Electric Generators](./Generators/Fire-Based/README.md)
* [Solar-based](./Generators/Solar-Based/README.md)
* [Wind-based](./Generators/Wind-Based/README.md)
* [Exercise-based](./Generators/Exercise-based/README.md)


List of Energy Storage Methods:
* Batteries
* Capacitors
* Heat Reservoirs

Important Topics:

* Basic
  * Electrical Power: Demand Vs. Total Usage
  * Voltage vs. Current

* Advanced:
  * boosting voltage
  * stepping voltage down
