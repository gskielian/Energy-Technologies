Fire-based Generators
=====================

There are a number of ways to utilize fire -- and in general temperature differences -- to harvest energy.  One method directly transforms that energy into electricity, and the other two directly transfer that energy into mechanical energy.

List:
* Peltier-effect
* Stirling-engine based
* NiTi Wire Based
