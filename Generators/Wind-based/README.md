Wind-based
==========


Another truly simple way to harvest energy is to have wind spin a DC Motor (or alternatively have wind move magnets across coils of metal wire).
In certain areas, these can provide a great deal of energy as long as there is enough wind (potentially 24 hours, reducing need for having a lot of stored energy).

We will discuss and compare:
* Size
* Costs
* Wattage per knot of wind


The page will provide resources for you to estimate the amount of energy you can attain from wind power from your area (but no guarantees, these are just estimates).
