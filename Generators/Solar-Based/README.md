Solar-based
===========

Solar power rocks, it is easy to collect, and simple to optimize (point solar receiver toward sun, and bingo)

## Solar Panels
Solar panels are one way of collecting solar energy, and while there are others, ubiquitousness of solar-panels merit particular analysis.

Different types of solar panels have different:
* spectral efficiencies
* robustness/durability
* cost

These factors will be compared for a variety of solar cell types, as well as a list of price quotes from suppliers (check the links for the most up-to-date prices).

## Other Solar Methods

One way to collect solar energy is to focus sunlight to create heat, this is an especially simple way to heat food (solar ovens and solar cookers).

Designs for these devices will be discussed in the following links:
* [Solar Cookers](./Solar-Cookers)
* [Solar->Steam](./Solar-to-Steam)
